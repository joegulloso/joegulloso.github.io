This repository hosts a simple game for balancing a ball on a moving platform.
Open `index.html` in a modern browser to play.

**Controls**

- Left Arrow: move the ball left
- Right Arrow: move the ball right
- Space: restart after game over

Stay on the platform as long as possible to increase your score!
The platform widens the challenge by moving a bit faster every time it
hits a wall.
