This repository hosts a simple game for balancing a ball on a moving platform.

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to play. The page shows a title above the
score and the platform is drawn with a subtle gradient for a nicer look.



**Controls**

- Left Arrow: move the ball left
- Right Arrow: move the ball right
- Space: restart after game over

Stay on the platform as long as possible to increase your score!
